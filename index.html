                <h3>Goal:</h3>
                    <p>Our mission is to make it easier and more focused for students to view the
                    courses they have chosen at Illinois Tech. We want to help as many students as 
                    possible take the courses they prefer within the limited add/drop time periods, and 
                    we want students to have a basic understanding of their instructors before they enroll.
                    </p>
                <h3>Application Features:</h3>
                    <p>Students can write reviews or study tips(but we'll check their reviews first then
                    decided posted on the app or not) for classes they have already taken to help future
                    students who choose that course, and to help students prepare for classes they will take.
                    Whatâ€™s more, IIT students can also rate teachers who have already taught a class on a scale
                    of 1-5. The purpose of this is to reduce students' concerns about unknown teachers' teaching
                    styles and to give them a better idea of the difficulty level of the course.</p>
